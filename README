NOTES:

- If you run this on a shared server, you should not pass your password as an argument as it is visible via ps ax. Instead you can set an environment variable:

export Y2M_PASSWORD=yourpassword
youtube2mediawiki.py -u .

- A small number of Videos does not have a WebM version created by youtube. For newly uploaded videos it takes usually some hours until the WebM transcodes are publicly available. Additionally Videos have to be set to "unlisted" or "public" available.

- Some YouTube Video IDs start with a hyphen. You can also pass a url like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YouTubeId or prepend a double hypen (--) to the YouTube ID to ensure youtube2mediawiki accepts them.

- Some names are not accepted on wiki projects and you may choose a more appropriate name using the NAME option (-n NAME.webm).
